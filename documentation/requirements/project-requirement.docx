Data Requirements - input data specification
id11 Publically available historical location data from the Swedish Transport Administration through their API for train information.
id21 Historical time table data and departure times. 
id22 (possible next stage) Historical arrival times. 
id23 Use data for SJ long-distance trains
id24 (possible next stage) Use data for all operators' long-distance trains departing from the station 
Functional Requirements
id31 The system shall cluster stations according to timely departure from the station or if trains are typically more than 5 minutes late when leaving the station. 
id32 (possible next stage) The system shall cluster stations according to timely departure from the station or if trains are typically 5-9 minutes, 10-15 minutes late when leaving the station. 
Performance Requirements - Accuracy
id41 The model shall achieve a minimum accuracy of [...] 
Performance Requirements - Response time
The system shall provide a classification within [specific time frame tbd] of receiving new data
System Requirements - Integration
id51 (perhaps remove) The system shall be capable of integrating with existing train tracking and scheduling platforms.
System Requirements - Scalability
id55 The system shall be designed to scale with an increase in data volume (increasing the time period analyzed) and complexity (other departures and destinations)
Compliance and Standards - Data Privacy
id61 The system shall use only publically available data from trains, so there is no issue to comply with relevant data protection regulations.
Compliance and Standards - Reporting
id65 The system shall generate responses that can be easily interpreted by stakeholders.
